# Postgres recipe: migrations and snapshots

This recipe shows the data layer of a real app. It tells you how to connect
to the Postgres database that xhostd gives you. It tells you how to run
alembic migrations safely. It tells you how to use the snapshots that the
platform takes before every deploy. This guide is one half of a pair. Both
guides describe the same app, and they divide the subject between them.

- **This guide owns the data layer.** It covers `DATABASE_URL`, the psycopg
  driver mismatch, the migrations in the start command, and the automatic
  snapshots before a deploy. It shows `alembic.ini`, `migrations/env.py`,
  `migrations/script.py.mako` and both files under `migrations/versions/`.
- **[The Docker recipe](https://docs.xhostd.com/guides/recipes-docker) owns
  the build.** It covers the Dockerfile, the warm base images, the image
  size cap, the `CMD` rules, and the health check. It shows `Dockerfile`,
  `requirements.txt` and `app.py`.

Nothing here is specific to the `docker` template. The same rules apply to
the `app` template, where the start command is `launch.sh` instead of `CMD`.

## What you get

Each non-static channel gets its own Postgres database. The platform makes that
database when it makes the channel. Your container reads the connection details
from an injected `DATABASE_URL`. A static channel has no database, so it gets no
`DATABASE_URL`.

The container also carries `DATABASE_URL_READONLY`: the same database, a
second role that can `SELECT` from every table in `public` and run no write.
Use it for a query surface you expose to visitors. Writes use
`DATABASE_URL`, and migrations use `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT`. Data the read-only role must not see goes in a schema you
create (`CREATE SCHEMA private`).

Schema changes ship as ordinary alembic migrations, and they run at container
start. The first boot of a new app applies every migration in order against
an empty database. A later deploy applies only the migrations that are new.
There is no manual step and no separate migration job.

Before each of those deploys, the platform saves a snapshot of the database.
The snapshot gives you a one-call undo if the deploy is wrong.

The worked example is live at
[recipe-docker-pg-docs.xhostd.app](https://recipe-docker-pg-docs.xhostd.app/).
Read it, but do not write to it. It is a real database behind a real write
API. The one note that it lists is the note that this guide restored it to.
If you obey the recipe on your own account, you get the same app under your
own name.

## The files

The app is `recipe-docker-pg`. This guide shows the five files of its data
layer. [The Docker recipe](https://docs.xhostd.com/guides/recipes-docker)
shows `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt` and `app.py` in full. All eight files
ship in one commit. The two guides divide the prose only, never the deploy.

### How the app connects

xhostd sets the database connection, and you set nothing. The app reads
two values:

- `DATABASE_URL` for the app's own queries. It can go through a
  transaction pooler, which holds a database session for one transaction
  at a time.
- `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` for the migrations. It always reaches the
  database server itself, so a migration keeps its session from start to
  end.

On a database with no pooler, the two values are equal.
[What a transaction pooler changes](#what-a-transaction-pooler-changes)
lists what breaks over `DATABASE_URL`. Your channel owns
a whole database, and your data is in the standard `public` schema of
that database. Your SQL therefore uses plain table names — `notes`, not
`someschema.notes`.

xhostd gives you `DATABASE_URL` with the bare `postgresql://` scheme:

```text
postgresql://<role>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
```

Do not use that scheme without a change from Python. SQLAlchemy maps
`postgresql://` to **psycopg2**, but this app ships **psycopg 3**
(`psycopg[binary]`). The correction is one line. It appears twice in this
app: once in `app.py`, and once in `migrations/env.py`.

```python
def database_url() -> str:
    """xhostd injects DATABASE_URL with the bare ``postgresql://`` scheme.

    SQLAlchemy maps that scheme to psycopg2, which we do not ship. Name
    the driver explicitly so it loads psycopg 3 instead.
    """
    return os.environ["DATABASE_URL"].replace(
        "postgresql://", "postgresql+psycopg://", 1
    )
```

If you do not make this correction, Python reports
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'`. See
[When it goes wrong](#when-it-goes-wrong).

### What a transaction pooler changes

A database on a newer server runs behind a transaction pooler, PgBouncer.
`DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_READONLY` reach the pooler on port 6432,
and `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` reaches the server itself on port 5432. A
database on an older server has no pooler, and all three name port 5432.
Read the port in `DATABASE_URL` to tell which case you are in. When the
platform moves a database to a newer server, `DATABASE_URL` can switch to
the pooler, and the notification that ends the move tells you so.

The pooler lends your connection a server session for one transaction at
a time. Anything that lives in a session and outlives a transaction
therefore breaks over `DATABASE_URL`:

- **A session `SET` of a setting the pooler does not track**, such as
  `statement_timeout`. Use `SET LOCAL` inside the transaction instead.
  The pooler keeps a session `SET` of a setting it tracks, such as
  `search_path`, `TimeZone`, or `application_name`.
- **A session advisory lock**, `pg_advisory_lock`. The transaction form,
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock`, works. Rails migrations, Prisma Migrate,
  GoodJob, and Que take session locks.
- **`LISTEN`.** Graphile Worker, Oban, River, and GoodJob listen. A
  `NOTIFY` works, because Postgres sends it when the transaction commits.
- **A temporary table** that must outlive its transaction.
- **A `WITH HOLD` cursor**, and Django's server-side cursors. Set
  `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS = True` in the Django `DATABASES` entry
  that uses `DATABASE_URL`.
- **An SQL `PREPARE` statement.** Your driver's protocol-level prepared
  statements work, because the pooler tracks them.
- **A startup parameter that the pooler does not track.** The pooler
  accepts `application_name`, `client_encoding`, `DateStyle`,
  `default_transaction_read_only`, `IntervalStyle`, `scram_iterations`,
  `search_path`, `session_authorization`, `standard_conforming_strings`,
  and `TimeZone`, set directly or with `-c` in the `options` parameter.
  It also accepts `extra_float_digits` and ignores it. It refuses any
  other parameter at connect with `unsupported startup parameter`, for
  example `?options=-c statement_timeout=5000` in the URL, or
  `server_settings={"jit": "off"}` in asyncpg. Use `SET LOCAL` in the
  transaction instead.

Run each of these over `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT`, or use the
transaction-scoped form. A migration tool and a job queue that listens
both read `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT`. This app's `migrations/env.py` does.

#### Prefer `DATABASE_URL` for your app's traffic

On every plan, send your app's queries through `DATABASE_URL`, because
the pooler gives it the higher limits. Through the pooler, many client
connections share a few real database connections, called **server
sessions**, and a server session is in use only while a transaction
runs. An idle connection in your app's pool holds nothing on the server.

Each `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` connection holds a server session of its own,
even while it is idle. It counts against your write role's cap and
against the server's total. Keep `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` for the few
connections that need a session feature from the list in
[What a transaction pooler changes](#what-a-transaction-pooler-changes),
such as a migration tool or a job queue that listens.

#### Connection limits

Each role has a cap on the server sessions it holds. The cap does not
count the connections your app opens to the pooler. The caps follow
your plan:

| Limit | Other plans | Studio | Pro |
|---|---|---|---|
| Write role, server sessions through the pooler | 5 | 10 | 20 |
| Write role, server sessions in all | 15 | 20 | 40 |
| Read-only role, server sessions | 5 | 10 | 20 |
| Connections per role to the pooler | 100 | 100 | 100 |

Through the pooler, a transaction waits for a free server session when
all of the role's pooled sessions are busy, so keep your transactions
short. Your direct sessions and your pooled ones share the write role's
cap, so a large direct pool leaves your own pooled queries waiting. Keep
the pool that uses `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` at 10 connections or fewer on
Studio and the other plans, and at 20 or fewer on Pro.

On Studio and Pro, your databases run on a database server of your own,
and all of your apps and channels share about 180 server sessions on it:
its `max_connections` of 200, less the sessions Postgres and the
platform keep for themselves. A direct pool in each of many channels
adds up toward that total, which is one more reason to send your app's
traffic through `DATABASE_URL`.

### alembic.ini

```ini
[alembic]
script_location = migrations

# sqlalchemy.url is deliberately absent: migrations/env.py reads
# DATABASE_URL from the environment instead, so no connection string is
# ever committed to the repo.

[loggers]
keys = root,sqlalchemy,alembic

[handlers]
keys = console

[formatters]
keys = generic

[logger_root]
level = WARNING
handlers = console
qualname =

[logger_sqlalchemy]
level = WARNING
handlers =
qualname = sqlalchemy.engine

[logger_alembic]
level = INFO
handlers =
qualname = alembic

[handler_console]
class = StreamHandler
args = (sys.stdout,)
level = NOTSET
formatter = generic

[formatter_generic]
format = %(levelname)-5.5s [%(name)s] %(message)s
```

The absent `sqlalchemy.url` is the point. xhostd injects your credentials, and
it rotates them independently of your code. Never put them in a file that you
commit.

Keep the log configuration blocks, but note that they do nothing until
`env.py` applies them. The next file shows how. After `env.py` applies them,
alembic logs at `INFO`. The line
`Running upgrade 0001 -> 0002, add done flag to notes` then goes to stdout.
The deploy log and `get_runtime_log` both read stdout.

### migrations/env.py

```python
import os
from logging.config import fileConfig

from alembic import context
from sqlalchemy import create_engine


def _url() -> str:
    # Migrations dial the database server directly: DATABASE_URL can go
    # through a transaction pooler, which drops session state. A channel
    # whose database has no pooler gets the same value in both variables.
    url = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL_DIRECT") or os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]
    return url.replace("postgresql://", "postgresql+psycopg://", 1)


def run_migrations_online() -> None:
    engine = create_engine(_url())
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        context.configure(connection=connection)
        with context.begin_transaction():
            context.run_migrations()


# alembic.ini's logging blocks stay inert until env.py applies them.
if context.config.config_file_name is not None:
    fileConfig(context.config.config_file_name)

run_migrations_online()
```

This `env.py` is minimal on purpose: no offline mode, no `target_metadata`,
and no autogenerate. Autogenerate compares your models to the live database,
so it needs both of them. A migration that you write by hand needs neither.
A smaller file has fewer failure modes.

Do not remove the `fileConfig` call. No other line reads the log
configuration blocks in `alembic.ini`. Without the call, the configuration
stays inert. Python then uses its last-resort handler at `WARNING`, and it
discards every `Running upgrade` line before the line reaches stdout. The
migration still runs. You lose the only proof in the deploy log that it ran,
and that proof is what you want when a deploy fails.

### migrations/script.py.mako

Alembic uses this template when you run `alembic revision`. Alembic needs the
file, and it fails without it. The content below is the standard content.

```text
"""${message}

Revision ID: ${up_revision}
Revises: ${down_revision | comma,n}
Create Date: ${create_date}

"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
${imports if imports else ""}

revision = ${repr(up_revision)}
down_revision = ${repr(down_revision)}
branch_labels = ${repr(branch_labels)}
depends_on = ${repr(depends_on)}


def upgrade() -> None:
    ${upgrades if upgrades else "pass"}


def downgrade() -> None:
    ${downgrades if downgrades else "pass"}
```

### migrations/versions/0001_create_notes.py

This is the first migration. It creates the table from nothing. The database
of each new channel starts in that empty state.

```python
"""create notes

Revision ID: 0001
Revises:

"""
import sqlalchemy as sa
from alembic import op

revision = "0001"
down_revision = None
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None


def upgrade() -> None:
    op.create_table(
        "notes",
        sa.Column("id", sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column("body", sa.Text, nullable=False),
        sa.Column(
            "created_at",
            sa.DateTime(timezone=True),
            server_default=sa.func.now(),
            nullable=False,
        ),
    )


def downgrade() -> None:
    op.drop_table("notes")
```

### migrations/versions/0002_add_note_done.py

This is the second migration. It adds a column to a table that can already
hold rows. It must be correct against the empty database of a first boot. It
must also be correct against a table with a year of production data.

```python
"""add done flag to notes

Revision ID: 0002
Revises: 0001

"""
import sqlalchemy as sa
from alembic import op

revision = "0002"
down_revision = "0001"
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None


def upgrade() -> None:
    # server_default plus nullable=False so the rows already in the table
    # get a value without a separate backfill step.
    op.add_column(
        "notes",
        sa.Column(
            "done", sa.Boolean(), server_default=sa.false(), nullable=False
        ),
    )


def downgrade() -> None:
    op.drop_column("notes", "done")
```

Learn the pattern of `server_default=sa.false()` with `nullable=False`.
Postgres fills the rows that exist from the default as part of the
`ADD COLUMN`. There is thus no separate backfill step, and the column is
never nullable. If you remove the `server_default`, the same migration still
runs in development against an empty table. It then fails at the first table
that holds rows. See [When it goes wrong](#when-it-goes-wrong). That default
is the reason why every note from this app reports `"done":false`, the first
note included.

Both migrations are in the app's first and only commit, and that is the usual
case. A migration ships in the same commit as the code that needs its column.
If you commit `app.py` without `0002`, you deploy an app whose every query
names a column that the database does not have.

A `downgrade()` costs one line here, so write one. But it is not the tool for
an emergency. The snapshots are that tool. They also work when the migration
leaves the schema in a state that `downgrade()` cannot reverse.

## The deploy

The whole app ships in one commit and one deploy: all eight files and both
migrations. **`git push` and then `deploy` is the standard path.** A push
sends only the diff, and needs no anchor to place it. The next schema change
thus costs a one-file commit and a push, not a tool call carrying anchors or
whole files. `commit_files` is
the fallback for one situation only: git is not available on the machine
where you work.

Both paths keep the same rule. **A push stores your code, but it does not
deploy your code.** `deploy` is a separate and explicit call.
[The Docker recipe](https://docs.xhostd.com/guides/recipes-docker) gives the
full sequence step by step: `create_app`, `get_credentials`, the clone and
the push, then `deploy`. This guide shows only the call that matters here:

```text
deploy(app_name="recipe-docker-pg",
       channel="prod",
       ref="master")
→ {"deploy_id": "a6baf3fc-f573-40f7-82c6-e74912525228",
   "channel_id": "16df8282-8498-4567-a595-fe769090b8b6",
   "status": "queued"}
```

`ref` resolves to the current head of that branch. A push and then a `deploy`
thus needs no sha.

That sequence has no migration step and no migration tool. The migrations
ship because they are in the commit. They run because the container's start
command runs `alembic upgrade head` before it starts the server:

```dockerfile
CMD ["sh", "-c", "alembic upgrade head && exec uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $XHOSTD_HTTP_PORT"]
```

The start command is the *only* correct place for `alembic upgrade head`.
xhostd injects environment variables at run time only, never as build args. A
build thus has no `DATABASE_URL`, and a migration at build time cannot work.
On the `app` template the same line goes in `launch.sh`, never in
`install.sh`, for the same reason.

## Verify it

Seven lines of that deploy log tell you what the data layer did.

```text
[2026-10-04T06:54:03+00:00] channel snapshot marker recorded
[2026-10-04T06:54:04+00:00] health_check container=1d6bdbce248e... port=3000 timeout=120.0s
[2026-10-04T06:54:08+00:00] [container] INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
[2026-10-04T06:54:08+00:00] [container] INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
[2026-10-04T06:54:08+00:00] [container] INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> 0001, create notes
[2026-10-04T06:54:08+00:00] [container] INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 0001 -> 0002, add done flag to notes
[2026-10-04T06:54:09+00:00] health_check ok
```

**`channel snapshot marker recorded`** is automatic. Every non-static deploy
records a snapshot of the channel's Postgres database *before* the new
container starts. The snapshot is thus the state immediately before that
deploy's changes. The marker copies no data. It records a moment in the
database's continuous backup, and a restore returns the database to that
moment. On the app's first deploy, that moment holds an empty database.

**The two `Running upgrade` lines** show the migrations at work. They run in
revision order against that empty database: `-> 0001` creates the table, then
`0001 -> 0002` adds the column. Alembic prints the `Context impl` and
`Will assume transactional DDL` banner on every run. Those two banner lines
tell you only that alembic started. The `Running upgrade` lines tell you that
the schema changed.

**`health_check ok` comes five seconds after the probe starts.** In those
five seconds `alembic upgrade head` runs, and then uvicorn binds its port.
The 120-second health window gives a migration the time to finish. The deploy
becomes healthy the moment the server answers `GET /`.

The schema now exists, so the API works. Write a row through it:

```bash
$ curl -sS -X POST https://recipe-docker-pg-docs.xhostd.app/notes \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"body":"first note from the recipe"}'
{"id":1}
```

### The snapshots

If you deploy the same commit again, you get a second snapshot. You also get
a second alembic transcript to compare with the first:

```text
[2026-10-04T06:54:17+00:00] channel snapshot marker recorded
[2026-10-04T06:54:24+00:00] [container] INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
[2026-10-04T06:54:24+00:00] [container] INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
[2026-10-04T06:54:26+00:00] health_check ok
```

The banner is there, but no `Running upgrade` line comes after it. The
database is already at head, so `alembic upgrade head` had no work and
printed no upgrade line. Read a deploy log by that difference. The banner
with a `Running upgrade` line means that the schema changed. The banner alone
means that the schema did not change.

`list_channel_snapshots` returns the snapshots newest first. This capture
came some minutes after the second deploy, so it also holds a `nightly`
snapshot that the platform took on its own schedule:

```text
list_channel_snapshots(app_name="recipe-docker-pg", channel="prod")
→ {
    "snapshot_id": "d13a318a-65cf-4144-87cb-02adbc16d451",
    "deploy_id": null,
    "kind": "nightly",
    "git_sha": "9a045a4ced33d6fe7e0dd5db787cf6b69c50f989",
    "created_at": "2026-10-04T06:58:29.191472Z",
    "aligned_blob": true,
    "recoverable": true
  }
  {
    "snapshot_id": "5f6aac2f-1852-482d-9aa5-40332376d0f6",
    "deploy_id": "dd0846fe-d4ce-49d4-80ac-c216d274381a",
    "kind": "pre_deploy",
    "git_sha": "9a045a4ced33d6fe7e0dd5db787cf6b69c50f989",
    "created_at": "2026-10-04T06:54:17.826155Z",
    "aligned_blob": true,
    "recoverable": true
  }
  {
    "snapshot_id": "fc1b4547-5ac4-44f2-a376-3de77a221fe6",
    "deploy_id": "a6baf3fc-f573-40f7-82c6-e74912525228",
    "kind": "pre_deploy",
    "git_sha": null,
    "created_at": "2026-10-04T06:54:03.150895Z",
    "aligned_blob": true,
    "recoverable": true
  }
```

Read the `deploy_id` on each `pre_deploy` snapshot. A snapshot is the state
immediately **before** that deploy. The oldest snapshot holds the empty schema,
from the point before the first deploy's migrations. Its `git_sha` is null,
because no code ran on the channel before that deploy. The snapshot of the
second deploy holds the table, which then existed and held the note. The
`nightly` snapshot names no deploy. It holds the database as it was when the
platform took it.

`recoverable: true` tells you that a restore can still reach the snapshot. A
new snapshot reads `false` until the database's archived backup reaches the
moment that the snapshot records. Expect that for some minutes after a deploy.

### Restore the database

**Database restore is temporarily unavailable.** xhostd refuses every
`restore_channel_db` call with `restore_unavailable` while it changes how a
restore runs to make it safer. For help with a restore, contact support.
This section shows the call, the refusal that it gets today, and the result
that a restore gives when it returns.

Add a second note, *after* the second deploy's snapshot:

```bash
$ curl -sS -X POST https://recipe-docker-pg-docs.xhostd.app/notes \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"body":"second note, added after the snapshot"}'
{"id":2}
```

A restore of **`prod`** is a protected action. An agent credential gets 403
`protected_action` until the app owner turns agent access on in the console,
and the refusal is the guard at work, not a fault. Ask the owner before you
restore. A restore saves no snapshot of the state that it replaces, because
the platform saves a snapshot before a deploy only. The rows that the restore
overwrites are thus not in the snapshot list after it.

Restore the channel to the snapshot from immediately before the second
deploy. That snapshot holds note 1 and not note 2.

```text
restore_channel_db(app_name="recipe-docker-pg",
                   channel="prod",
                   snapshot_id="5f6aac2f-1852-482d-9aa5-40332376d0f6")
→ restore_unavailable: database restore is temporarily unavailable — contact support for help with a restore
```

The refusal changes nothing, so the database still holds both notes:

```bash
$ curl -sS https://recipe-docker-pg-docs.xhostd.app/
{"ok":true,"notes":2,"done":0}

$ curl -sS https://recipe-docker-pg-docs.xhostd.app/notes
{"notes":[{"id":1,"body":"first note from the recipe","done":false,"created_at":"2026-10-04T06:54:14.952930+00:00"},{"id":2,"body":"second note, added after the snapshot","done":false,"created_at":"2026-10-04T06:54:37.827818+00:00"}]}
```

When restore returns, it works as follows.

The restore runs in one transaction on the server. xhostd first empties the
database's `public` schema, then it writes the snapshot's contents into that
schema. The server rolls the whole transaction back if any step fails, so a
failed restore loses nothing. The call returns the channel's Postgres status,
which is `ready` when the restore succeeds. The same `DATABASE_URL` continues
to work with no new deploy. Only the data changes: it is back at the state of
the snapshot. After a restore to that snapshot, `GET /notes` returns note 1
alone. Note 2 is gone. Note 1 keeps its original `created_at`, not a new one.
A restore writes the snapshot's rows again, but it does not run your writes
again.

The `"done":false` value on each note comes from `0002`'s
`server_default`. The app's `INSERT` names `body` only, so Postgres supplies
the column's default. The same default fills the column for the rows already
in the table when the migration runs. A migration without that default fails
in exactly that case.

There is a second guard. xhostd refuses a restore while a deploy on the
channel is queued or in progress. Wait for the deploy to finish, then try
again.

A restore of the database does not restore your code. If you restore to a
state before a migration, also deploy the commit that matches that state.
If you do not, the next container start applies the migration again.

## PostGIS

The database server marks PostGIS trusted, so a migration installs it
with no superuser. Install the extension in the migration that first needs
a geometry column, add the column, and add a GiST index on it in the same
migration. The extension is a one-time cost of about two seconds and
7.5 MB per database.

```python
def upgrade() -> None:
    op.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis")
    op.add_column(
        "places",
        sa.Column("location", Geometry("POINT", srid=4326), nullable=True),
    )
    op.create_index(
        "ix_places_location",
        "places",
        ["location"],
        postgresql_using="gist",
    )
```

`Geometry` comes from the `geoalchemy2` package; add it to
`requirements.txt` beside `psycopg[binary]`. Raw SQL works the same way:
`ALTER TABLE places ADD COLUMN location geometry(Point, 4326)` and
`CREATE INDEX ix_places_location ON places USING GIST (location)`.

Only `postgis` is installable. `postgis_raster`, `postgis_topology`,
`postgis_sfcgal`, and the tiger geocoder stay untrusted. `spatial_ref_sys`
is read-only for your role, with every EPSG code present. A snapshot
restore, a move, and an export all carry a PostGIS database.

## When it goes wrong

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'`

This is the most frequent failure for a Python app on this platform, and it
has one cause. `DATABASE_URL` arrives with the bare `postgresql://` scheme,
and SQLAlchemy maps that scheme to psycopg2. Most projects do not install
psycopg2, because psycopg 3 is the driver that Python projects ship.

The container starts and then stops immediately, so the deploy fails on the
health check. No line in the deploy log mentions the database. Read the
container's own output, not the health-check line alone:

```text
get_runtime_log(app_name="...", channel="prod", command="tail -n 200 app.log")
```

To correct it, name the driver in the URL at each point where you make an
engine:

```python
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"].replace("postgresql://", "postgresql+psycopg://", 1)
```

Do this in `migrations/env.py` and in your application code. If you do it in
one place only, the failure is harder to find: the app serves requests, and
the migration step is the part that stops.

You can instead install `psycopg2-binary` and keep the URL as it is. That
also works, but your dependency tree then holds two Postgres drivers as soon
as another package needs psycopg 3.

### The migration ran at build time, or not at all

`alembic upgrade head` cannot work in a `RUN` step, or in `install.sh` on the
`app` template. xhostd injects the environment at run time only, never as
build args, so a build has no `DATABASE_URL`. The symptom changes with the
way your code reads the variable. You see a `KeyError`, a refused connection,
or a migration that applies to nothing.

Put the command in the start command: `CMD` for `docker`, `launch.sh` for
`app`. Put it before the line that starts your server, and join the two with
`&&`. A failed migration then stops the deploy. Without the `&&`, the server
starts against a stale schema.

### The code shipped without the migration it needs

Every query in `app.py` names the `done` column, and `done` exists because
`0002` creates it. If you commit one without the other, the container starts,
connects, and stops at its first query:

```text
sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (psycopg.errors.UndefinedColumn) column "done" does not exist
```

The deploy then fails on the health check, and its log says nothing about a
column. The exception is in the container's own output, which you read with
`get_runtime_log`. Ship a migration in the same commit as the code that needs
it. The code and the schema are then never one deploy apart, and
`alembic upgrade head` in the start command is sufficient. Some changes
cannot travel together, such as a rename or a column drop. For those, first
write code that accepts both shapes. Then make the schema change in a later
deploy, after no live version needs the old shape.

### A `NOT NULL` column with no `server_default`

This recipe's `0002` migration sets a `server_default`, so it does not have
this failure. If you remove that default, Postgres reports:

```text
column "done" of relation "notes" contains null values
```

A `NOT NULL` column that you add to a table with rows fails, because Postgres
has no value for those rows. The migration passes in development against an
empty table. It fails at the first deploy to a channel with real data.

Add `server_default` in the same `op.add_column`, as `0002` does. If the
value can have no default, use three migrations. Add the column as nullable,
backfill it, then set `NOT NULL`. Note that the backfill step can exceed the
health-check window.

### The migration takes longer than the health check allows

The health window is 120 seconds from container start, and your migration
runs inside it. A migration that rewrites a large table can exhaust the
window. A migration that waits for a lock from the old container, which still
runs, can also exhaust it. The deploy then fails on the health check while
the migration is still in progress.

Keep a deploy-time migration short, and do not let it block. Use
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` in place of a plain `CREATE INDEX`. Add a column
with a default in place of a rewrite of the rows. Move a long backfill out of
the deploy path. Ship the schema change first, then run the backfill as its
own step after the app is live.

### An UNLOGGED table is refused

xhost refuses every UNLOGGED table and sequence. A statement that makes one
fails, and Postgres rolls the statement back:

```text
ERROR:  UNLOGGED tables and sequences are not supported on xhost
DETAIL:  public.cache is UNLOGGED.
HINT:  Remove UNLOGGED from the statement. xhost backs up, restores, and moves only logged data; see docs.xhostd.com/postgres. In Rails, remove create_unlogged_tables from config/environments.
```

Why: Postgres writes no write-ahead log for the rows of an UNLOGGED table.
xhost backs up your database from that log, and it moves your database
between servers with logical replication, which carries none of those rows
either. A restore or a move would come back without them, and a crash of the
database server empties the table.

The refusal covers each statement that leaves a table or a sequence
UNLOGGED: `CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE`, `CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE … AS`,
`SELECT … INTO UNLOGGED`, `ALTER TABLE … SET UNLOGGED`,
`CREATE UNLOGGED SEQUENCE`, and `ALTER SEQUENCE … SET UNLOGGED`. A temporary
table is not affected.

To fix a refused statement, remove the `UNLOGGED` keyword. A logged table
accepts the same queries, and it survives a restore and a move. A framework
can add the keyword for you:

- **Alembic and SQLAlchemy.** The keyword comes from `prefixes=["UNLOGGED"]`
  on `op.create_table` or on a `Table`. Remove it.
- **Rails.** Remove the line
  `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter.create_unlogged_tables = true`
  from each file in `config/environments/`.

A database made before xhost refused UNLOGGED tables can still hold one. The
table keeps its rows. Until you make it logged, xhost cannot move the
database to another server, and the table takes no change that leaves it
UNLOGGED, such as `ADD COLUMN` or `CREATE INDEX`. Make it logged from a
migration of its own:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.cache SET LOGGED;
```

The statement rewrites the table. The sequences the table owns, such as the
one behind a `serial` column, become logged with it. A sequence that no
table owns needs its own statement:

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE public.ticket SET LOGGED;
```

To find what is left, run this query. An empty result means no UNLOGGED
table or sequence remains:

```sql
SELECT n.nspname, c.relname, c.relkind
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
WHERE c.relpersistence = 'u'
  AND c.relkind IN ('r', 'p', 'S')
  AND n.nspname NOT LIKE 'pg\_%'
  AND n.nspname <> 'information_schema';
```

The refusal comes from an extension, `xhost_guard`, that xhost installs in
your database. `\dx` in psql lists it, and your role cannot drop or disable
it. The console's dump download and an export leave it out. A `pg_dump` that
you run yourself contains a `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS xhost_guard`
line, which a Postgres server outside xhost cannot load. For such a server,
pass `--exclude-extension=xhost_guard`, which needs `pg_dump` 17 or later.

### 404 and 502 from the hostname mean different things

A channel that exists but has no route returns **404** on its hostname. A
channel with a route but no live server returns **502**. Both codes help you.
A 404 tells you that the deploy did not reach `caddy ensure_route`. A 502
tells you that the deploy reached it, but the container does not serve. For a
Python app on this platform, a 502 is often the psycopg2 failure above.
